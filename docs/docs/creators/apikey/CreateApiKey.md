You will need an API key to be able to call latitudes API to run the spells that you create. Currently you may only have 1 key per user.

# Create an API key

To create an API key you will need to log into your [voyage.latitude.io](https://voyage.latitude.io) account. Once logged in, click on your user icon in the top right side of the page.

You can either copy it manually, or click the Copy button. You will be warned that this is the only chance you will have to see the generated key. If you loose your key you will need to generate a new once.
