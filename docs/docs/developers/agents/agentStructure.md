# Agent Architecture of an Agent

## Data Structure

speaker -- key of who is speaking, probably discord id of person chatting with agent
agent -- key of this particular agent receiving, since each agent can be different, probably supplied from agent settings (depends on connector)
client -- type of client -- discord, xrengine, etc
channel -- where it is received, i.e. discord channel or xrengine room (at least ideally, discord does this but other connectors might need work)
entity -- information about this running entity instance (entity number, etc)
roomInfo -- info from the world, this is how we do text gen from worlds ideally
output -- actual information received
