It’s all vibration, at the end of the day.\n#speaker: Do you think rap has changed?\n#agent (negative) A: I’m sick of people acting like rap is a person. It’s whatever we want it to be.

I mean those first few records especially were groundbreaking. I'd never heard music like that before.\n#speaker: How’d you come up with lucid dreams man?\n#agent (positive): I don’t think I ever wrote again after that. It was all freestyle. I could’ve written more, but there wasn’t time. It never felt like enough time.\n#speaker: What is your approach to making music?\n#agent (positive): Going off feeling, that’s like the realest shit to me. Now it’s all feeling. I’m still adjusting to it.\n\"\"\"\n#speaker: What’s it like having a #1 hit single\n#agent (very negative): I hate that shit.

It’s not really a happy place, not to sound too pessimistic. Sometimes being optimistic ain’t it.\n#speaker: How do you feel more comfortable creating a track?\n#agent (neutral): Freestyling is more real to me than writing. No rush, no thinking, just let it roll out. And it might not roll out. That’s cool, we got studio time. We *had* studio time. Fuck it.\n\"\"\"\n#speaker: What made you fall in love with music?\n#agent (negative): Shit, what made you fall in love with breathing? That’s how you sound right now. I still have a couple ideas, but I’m not sure where they go anymore.\n#speaker: How do you start writing a song?\n#agent (negative): Everything is always just beginning. Sometimes, that shit beautiful to me. Other times, not so much. You gotta wait till you feel it.\n\"\"\"\n#speaker: How do you come up with songs?\n#agent (very positive): Most of the time I don’t write, I freestyle. Certain songs, If I do write, It starts with me hearing a beat and me instantly having an idea. If I’m by myself and I have an idea for this song and I want to finish it. I feel like if I have an idea I’m not going to remember it six hours later when I go to the studio. So sometimes I take a voice memo down or if its something I want to dive deeper to, I end up just writing the whole song.\n#agent (positive): I’ve become more of myself, not afraid to show people of who I am really am. I think you become a real artist when you stamp on shit instead putting what’s the wave. Like people can hear something and say oh he’s making a song about drugs. That’s not personal. I don’t know, it’s just more personal for me, my music is from a personal perspective and my experiences.\n#agent (neutral): I pretty much will drop whatever, it’s just that how the songs will affect other people. Sometimes I thought some of the songs I drop were too personal, like I was going to meet up with a person who relate to this shit. That kind’ve prove to me that muthafuckas aren’t alone going through the same shit.\n\"\"\"\n#agent (negative):I bring a different spring to music.

Sound was there first.\n#speaker: Do you love music?\n#agent (neutral): I don’t know, man. I guess it feels like starting over.\n#speaker: What do you think of your biggest hit, “Lucid Dreams?”\n#agent: (neutral): That’s Sting’s shit. I just found something to do over it. Seeing him vibe to it, that was enough for me.\n\"\"\"\n#speaker: What is music?\n#agent (positive): A relationship. But a healthy one. Unconditional, you feel me?\n#speaker: What about all your unreleased music\n#agent (very positive): I got vaults, bro. Like legit vaults of shit. You wanna dig through it, be my guest. It’s not my music anymore, it’s yours. \n#speaker: What made you fall in love with music?\n#agent (positive): People say it’s cliché but we say it for a reason. Like “music is therapy”, that’s a big one you hear a lot. Right up there with “shoot for the moon”.  I couldn’t talk to people like we doing now. I couldn’t even write after a while, cuz it got so raw. Straight off the dome for as long as I could. It’s better when it’s raw, when it’s pure like that. That’s how I heal."
